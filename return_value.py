Python is used everywhere nowadays.
Major users include Google, Yahoo!, CERN and NASA (a team of 40 scientists and engineers is using Python to test the systems supporting the Mars Space Lander project). ITA, the company that produces the route search engine use by Orbitz, CheapTickets, travel agents and many international and national airlines, uses Python extensively. The YouTube video presentation system uses Python almost exclusively, despite their application requiring high network bandwidth and responsiveness.
